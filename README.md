# PiDrive
Self Driving Raspberry Pi Project

Our goal with PiDrive was to train an image processing neural net (adapted from: https://vimeo.com/19569529), to make a raspberry pi powered car drive autonomously on a paper track. We nearly achieved this goal, but fell short in that we only got as far as collecting training data, and training a network--we did not have time to exectute it on the pi. 

For more information on how to get up and running (skill required, comment to ask for help), read the README's in the Pi and PC folders. You will need:

Your own car
Bluetooth kbd/mouse,
raspberry pi, SD card, internet...,
Windows PC (Linux is untested, but should work),
A lot of patience and time

This is my first GitHub project!
